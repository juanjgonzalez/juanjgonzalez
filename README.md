- ðŸ‘‹ Hi all , Iâ€™m @juanjgonzalez, Iâ€™m 30 years old at the time of this post and Iâ€™am a Full stack developer.
  - You know, even when you start with the programming stuff you donâ€™t always use github and all the things that it can give to you.So now Iâ€™m trying to implement 
    and be a better developer 
- **A bit about myself**:
  - Iâ€™m from Argentina, a country always in flame :fire:
  - I know little about .NET, Angular, SQL Server.
  - Love seeing a good serie or movie but in this time is hard to find a good one.
  - ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m really interested in Flutter and MongoDB. Would try to upload something with that.
  - ðŸŒ± Always learning ...
